    <h2>My Music</h2>
    <h4>Hello! My name is Jens but I use the moniker "IceBox" for my identity in music.</h4> <br>
    I have been a music producer and vocalist since 2019. Additionally, I have been playing guitar since age 13. <br>
    Over the years, I have played the roles of either lead or rhythm guitar for multiple small bands, though I didn't release any music until embarking upon my solo career.<br>
    My music is probably aggressive and violent to others; however, it holds significant therapeutic value to me.<br>
    Music guided me through a very troubling adolescence and has acted as a conduit for my negativity since that time.<br>
    While I understand my music may not be for everyone, I hope it reaches those who endured strife as well.<br><br>
    <h2>Have a great day, thanks for stopping by and reading!</h2>
