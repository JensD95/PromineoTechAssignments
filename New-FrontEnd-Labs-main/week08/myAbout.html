    <h4 id="small-header">Hello! My name is Jens but I use the moniker "IceBox" for my identity in music.</h4>
    <p class="bulk-text">I have been a music producer and vocalist since 2019. Additionally, I have been playing guitar since age 13.
    Over the years, I have played the roles of either lead or rhythm guitar for multiple small bands, though I didn't release any music until embarking upon my solo career.
    My music is probably aggressive and violent to others; however, it holds significant therapeutic value to me.
    Music guided me through a very troubling adolescence and has acted as a conduit for my negativity since that time.
    While I understand my music may not be for everyone, I hope it reaches those who endured strife as well.</p><br>
    <p class="introductory-text">Below I have listed my released albums in the order of release and with their corresponding cover photos.</p> <br>
